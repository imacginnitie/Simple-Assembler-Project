# Simple-Assembler-Project
A high school project creating an assembler using chunking and tokenization to assemble a program from a text file into executable machine code binary.
To test the assembler, we developed a

in Swift for a Turing machine program written in assembly language.
I wrote and largely designed the assembler, including the chunker and tokenizer, and the VM as part of a 2018 Newton South High School Honors Advanced Programming class. We were given an outline for the project and some hints, but the majority of the code was self-designed and written by me. However, the Turing machine assembly program and the partial, nonfunctional debugger was written by fellow student Michelle Pan.
