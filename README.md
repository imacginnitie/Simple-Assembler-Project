# Simple-Assembler-Project
A high school project creating an assembler in Swift for a Turing machine program written in assembly language. It uses chunking and tokenization to assemble a program from a text file into executable machine code binary, as well as a virtual machine to run and test the assembler.
I wrote and largely designed the assembler, including the chunker and tokenizer, and the virtual machine as part of a 2018 Newton South High School Honors Advanced Programming class. We were given an outline for the project and some hints, but the majority of the code was self-designed and independently written by. However, the Turing machine's assembly program and the partial, nonfunctional debugger was written by fellow student Michelle Pan.
